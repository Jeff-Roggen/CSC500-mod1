#CSC500 - Module One Critical Thinking Assignment - Part 1 and Part 2 
#Jeff Roggen

#Part 1 - Add and subtract numbers and display equation
  #1. Get the first number from the user.
  #2. Convert the first number to a floating-point number.
  #3. Display the first number.
  #4. Get the second number from the user.
  #5. Convert the second number to a floating-point number.
  #6. Display the second number.
  #7. Calculate the sum of the two numbers and display the equation.
  #8. Calculate the difference between the two numbers and display the equation.

# Get first number
num1 = input('Enter first number:\n')
num1 = float(num1)
print("The first number is:", num1)

# Get second number
num2 = input('Enter second number:\n')
num2 = float(num2)
print("The second number is:", num2)

# Display addition and subtraction results
print(num1, "+", num2, "=", num1 + num2)
print(num1, "-", num2, "=", num1 - num2)


#Part 2 - Multiply and divide numbers and display equation
  #1. Get the first number from the user.
  #2. Convert the first number to a floating-point number.
  #3. Display the first number.
  #4. Get the second number from the user.
  #5. Convert the second number to a floating-point number.
  #6. Display the second number.
  #7. Calculate the product of the two numbers and display the equation.
  #8. Validate the second number is not zero.
  #9. Calculate the quotient by dividing num1 by num2 and display the equation.

print('Please enter two new numbers')

# Get and validate first number
num1 = input('Enter first number:\n')
num1 = float(num1)
print("The first number is:", num1)

# Get and validate second number
num2 = input('Enter second number:\n')
num2 = float(num2)
print("The second number is:", num2)

# Display multiplication result
print(f"{num1} * {num2} = {num1 * num2}")
    
# Check for division by zero
if num2 != 0:
    print(num1, "/", num2, "=", num1 / num2)
else:
    print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed")
